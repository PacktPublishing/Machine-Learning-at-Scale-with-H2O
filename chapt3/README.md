# Chapter 3: Fundamental Workflow - Data to Deployable Model
The Jupyter notebooks here show the fundamental workflow we developed in Chapter 3.

* ***local-cluster.ipynb*** is to launch an H2O cluster locally

* ***enterprise-cluster.ipynb*** is to launch an H2O cluster on the H2O AI Cloud https://h2o.ai/freetrial/
