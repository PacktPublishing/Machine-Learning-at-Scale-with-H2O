This means that it will be easy for me to pay back the loan without any problems at all.<br><br>In the past, we ran into some financial problems because (1) we did not budget for expenses, (2) we had no savings set aside, and (3) we often spent more than we earned--either because of mismanagement or unforeseen expenses/emergencies. Happily, a couple of years ago, we took a personal finance managing class that equipped us with the knowledge and insight we needed to change our habit and become good money managers.

I have seven (7) different accounts, each of which has variable monthly payments. I also have seven (7) monthly bills I pay, which means a lot of stress in total. I would like to use this loan to reduce the stress and paperwork of managing seven different credit accounts and also to manage my cash more responsibly.<br/><br/>I have recently relocated from Detroit, MI, to San Antonio, TX, for a career as a Linux Systems Administrator at Rackspace. Rackspace is a very profitable web hosting company whose only competitors are Google and Amazon, and the pay and benefits are competitive. I have been working with the company since August 2010, and I am truly excited that I have found peers and friends with Rackspace. Not only is the working environment positive, but I am also enjoying my job and taking advantage of the many professional development opportunities that Rackspace provides its employees. In short, I have found a long-term home for myself, and I am now one of the lucky few who loves their job.<br/><br/>I have a comfortable monthly income of $4,300, of which I spend about $1,000 per month for all rent and bills, including car payment (2010 Honda Fit). After food and gas, this leaves me approximately $3,000 to work with for paying off debts or other investment. I am also trying to build stronger credit so I can settle here in San Antonio permanently, and eventually build a home. Please note that none of my debt includes any day-to-day living expenses. All of my current debt consists of computer equipment, which is being used to test and develop business ideas. This equipment can be liquidated if the need arises.<br/><br/>Because my technical interests are aligned with the work I do for Rackspace, the potential for professional advancement is very high. Consolidating my debts into a single simple payment will allow me to save time and focus on my career, which is my top priority.<br/>","debt_consolidation","TX",9.45,0,3,9,0,10081,67.7,13,0,4

The restaurant is run by a lean and experienced team that has committed to stay with the business in the event I acquire it. I have conducted due diligence over the past few days and have personally observed the flow of the business and am confident about what I have seen to buy this business putting my own capital to risk.<br/><br/>I have extensive experience in running businesses over the past two decades in Asia and in the United States. I was instrumental in building the largest Asian media franchise in the Americas (the USA, Canada and the Caribbean) building it from zero to over $55mn. in sales with operating profits in excess of $20mn. Before that, I was co-founder of a software technology company that was bought out at a significant premium.<br/><br/>I require an amount of about $25,000 to consummate this acquisition. I am extremely confident that the cash flow provided by the business will be more than sufficient to meet the monthly payments. My confidence is borne out by the fact that this restaurant has held its own during the extremely difficult economic period over the past twelve months. <br/><br/>I look forward to a positive result as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Thank you very much.<br/>","small_business","TX",10.12,0,0,11,0,6341,21.4,44,0,10

I currently live at home (no rent) and have a secure, full-time position at an investment firm outside Boston, MA.   I am currently making two separate payments on high-interest debts. The first is a consolidation from college which totals approximately $10,700 (I've been making consistent payments of $318/month). The second is a credit card with approximately $4,500 on it. Both of these debts are costing me 15%+ per annum. I'm consistent with my payments and am making enough where this payment will not be an issue.  My goal through the use of this site is to cut that % down as far as possible. I appreciate your interest in lending to me for this purpose.

It is currently at a 0% promotional rate but will climb to 19.9% next month. This loan will completely pay off this card and I'd like to have it refinanced before my rate jumps. The minimum payment on this card is only $150/month but I currently pay around $750/month so this is a net gain for me in terms of payment amount.<br/><br/>I accumulated my credit card debt a few years ago when I started my own business with my own money and credit. It was not very successful and I have been back to work for another company since May 2009. I am a consultant with the US Navy and have a very stable position despite the government scaling back. Other than the amount of debt my credit has been flawless - no missed or late payments ever. All of our extra money goes to bringing down our debt and we've cut out a lot of unnecessary expenses (cable, etc.). We will soon lower our rent payments too as we're going to be moving to a new place with roommates.<br/><br/>I can more than cover all of my obligations and this will not increase my overall debt, just refinance it. The income listed is also a little low as it only represents the salary from my job. We have additional income from my wife, my VA disability and a 2nd mortgage we are still holding from a property we owned in our former business. That mortgage is a 3 year balloon that matures next February and will be worth a little over $26,000.

I need to rebuild the head on the motor(which alone would cost $2000) which will require me to pull out the motor.  Rather than just replacing the head with the stock engine internals, I plan on purchasing a fully custom built motor which will cost approximatley $5,000 to $6,500 depending on the options.  This will also help increase the value of the car and provide more longevity.  The car is so rare that since I purchased it in 2005, it's value has only depreciated $2000.  I am willing to use it as collateral if necessary.  Also, on my credit report there is one delinquent account for like $120, which I am in the process of trying to resolve right now.  It was from an AT&T wireless bill from like 2000/2001 which I settled and just popped up with a collection agency.  I called AT&T and they can't even find the account in their systems.  So now I am in the process of trying to resolve it with Pallisades collections.  I am also going to be interested in purchasing the home I currently live in from my parents within the next 2 to 3 years, and want to be able to qualify for a good rate on a loan.  Since I have no long term payment history this would be a good chance for me to build that type of credit.  I currently live with 2 other roommates who pay 90% of the current mortgage, hence my rent being so low.  Thank You Frank R. Kaspar","major_purchase","FL",1.71,0,0,4,0,1487,45.1,9,1,7

258644,15000," 36 months",486.76,"B","B4",5,"RENT",53307,"not verified",1.201824e+12,"n","Purpose of loan:   In a random audit, the IRS has informed me that when I was partially self-employed and doing my taxes in 2002 and 2003, I did them quite wrong. They would now like to reward me by telling me to pay them an additional $10,000 to $14,000 in back taxes, fees and penalties. (Total amount not yet confirmed, any excess received from loan would be paid back on loan.) While they may be able to offer me an installment plan, they warned me quite strongly that paying by installment will rack up much heavier penalties and interest.   My Financial Situation:   I am well employed at a position I have held for over 5 years. My yearly gross salary in 2007 was $53,307. My current FICO scores are: TransUnion - 760, Equifax - 741, Experian - 726.     Current Debt:    I currently have only one major debt in $30,000 spread over two student loans, but they are at low interest and the monthly payment is quite low. I also have several small credit cards opened solely for the purpose of improving my credit rating and used sparingly only for that purpose and are paid off monthly. Lastly, I have a Prosper loan with a $4000 balance remaining from another peer-to-peer lending network for previous debt consolidation, which I have never missed a payment on.   Negative Credit Information:     You will note in my credit information it shows a bunch of old late payments. These are solely from an old, paid off student loan. (Not the other one I am still paying on - it has no late payments.) I have no other late payments on any account.     Monthly NET Income: $2,799.74  Monthly expenses: $1683.00     (Costs are low because I split in half with partner/roommate. However, income would cover full bills in emergency with careful budgeting.)    Housing: $387  Insurance: $12 (Rental) Car expenses: $24 (Bus Pass) Utilities: $80  Phone, cable, internet: $80  Food, entertainment: $450  Clothing, household expenses: $50 Credit cards and other loans: $500 (Primarily previous Prosper Loan & student loans) Other expenses: $100     Expenses I don't have: Car payments or car insurance (I ride the bus). Health insurance 100% paid by employer.     Remaining monthly funds: $1117  These remaining funds have been previously split between voluntary contributions to retirement plan and emergency savings funds. This remaining money would be partially reallocated to paying new Prosper loan. I currently have an emergency savings fund of $6500 which I prefer to not use for this tax bill as I believe it is important to have a savings fund in case of an emergency such as injury or illness.     In Conclusion:    I am a solid investment who has never been late on their previous Prosper loan. I am not borrowing for frivolous reasons, risky business ventures or to pay something I could not pay otherwise in a different manner. I am asking for this loan in order to save money on penalties, fees and interest I would otherwise have to pay on the IRS back taxes that would be more in the long term than the interest I would pay through a peer-to-peer loan. I believe this is a sound financial move after careful and intensive consideration. I also far prefer to support the peer-to-peer lending system than be a slave to the IRS.     If you have any questions or would like additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me. ","debt_consolidation","WA",11.37,0,0,7,0,24,0.3,8,0,7

During this program, I met my girlfriend with whom I sincerely want to spend the rest of my life.  Being early in my career, I make what I consider a very respectable salary.  However, given the nature of the career path that I am on, the amount of money that I have saved is not enough to buy a ring that would be respectable 10 years down the road.  I have always felt strongly about wanting my wife to have a ring that she would not want to upgrade down the road.  My girlfriend isn't the type that would do this.  However, I foresee both of us being successful to the point that I don't want a very modest ring to stand out.  I believe that by taking out a $10,000 loan I will be able to get her something that is not gaudy or pretentious, yet also not something that will stand out down the road as not being up to the standards that one would expect for a successful woman.<br/><br/>Regarding the 3 delinquent payments on my credit record, these were late payments on cards that I held jointly with my Dad during school.  The bills were sent to my parents house, and there was one particular month where my Dad made late payments on 3 cards (under 30 days).  I personally, have never made a late payment on a bill of any sort.<br/> Borrower added on 04/12/10 > I should also mention that I recently received an excellent evaluation from my boss, accompanied by a raise.

I was funded a loan through Prosper for credit consolidation at a higher rate with the intent to use that loan to pay down credit cards (as I have upon receipt of the loan).  Now that I have completed that part of my journey and discovered Lending Club, I would like to continue moving payments away from banks to share with fellow members at a lower rate to save money and ultimately reduce debt.  This loan will be used to pay off the prosper loan in its entirety, and the remaining balance will be used as a one time payment for school.  <br/><br/>As you will see, I never pay my bills late and my credit worthiness is consistent.  My priority is getting and keeping my credit as clear as possible since I am recently engaged with hopes to buy a house in a few years.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your time in considering investing in my loan.<br/>","other","CA",10.26,0,0,6,0,2439,61.5,9,1,11

Financially 10% interest savings is a big savings and just makes sense.  <br/><br/>My wife and I's monthly budgeted income after taxes is approximately 5,100 (my income being about 3,100 of it).  She currently pays the mortgage and our goal is to pay down the credit cards so we can look to having kids.   <br/><br/>We recently purchased a home and added a bathroom to the house (9 month process) in order to plan for a family.  It cost more than we anticipated. We plan on paying this debt accumulated during this time down as soon as possible in order to create some financial freedom and in order to create a better environment for our future children.<br/><br/>My job is as a sr. software developer at a company I've been a part of for over 3.5 years.  My company is actually doing very well and is expanding our company and group by several employees this spring.  I have been tapped as a possible supervisor for this new group we are creating so I might be in line for a promotion down the line.<br/><br/>What makes me a good borrower?<br/>I always pay back what I owe.  Several years ago as i graduated college, I had racked up over $35k in credit card debt and was laid off.  I could have declared bankruptcy but didn't want the ding on my credit.  In less than 3 years, I had paid it down to $5k by just saving my money and being better on what I spent it on. <br/><br/>I am not sure if to include my wifes or not so here is the details of both<br/>Monthly budget:<br/>Mortgage: $960  (my wife currently pays this as I am responsible for all other bills , food, gas etc)<br/>Electric/gas: aprox. $270 (wife pays)<br/>Gas for work:$200<br/>Food+misc. household items: $350<br/>Car Insurance: $135<br/>Water Bill: Aproximately $60<br/>Phone: $100  (its actually $180 but my brother in law covers $80 on a family plan every month)<br/>Cable/Internet/Lan Line: $150<br/>School Loans: $144<br/>Associated Bank loan: $100<br/>Balance on a set of couches bought at xmas on store card: $100 until balance is paid ($1800 is left, no interest until 2011)<br/> Borrower added on 03/16/10 > Explanation of Delinquency:<br/>I attempted about 5 years ago to get into the rental house business.  Unfortunately, I picked the worst timing to do so.  I overpaid for the duplex, couldn't get it rented, and was unable to sell it back and it was foreclosed on.  Instead of foreclosing and walking away, i used my credit cards for the mortgage in an attempt to still sell the home and prevent the foreclosure.  this led to all my cc's at the time skyrocketing their interest rate (above 30%). this was also around the time i was laid off. since then im proud to say ive paid down a significant amount of the debt (at an absolute unreasonable interest rate).  With credit cards getting sneakier with the new laws on what to do with your interest rate, this seems to be a safer route to a fair interest rate percentage.  My goal is to become debt free in order to start expanding our family and being able to afford it.<br/>","credit_card","OH",11.5,0,0,10,0,5636,21.1,34,0,13

For the first time in my life, I was unemployed in 2001 (last recession) for 8 months and used credit cards to pay expenses.  I chose not to file bankruptcy as I felt responsible to pay my debts. A few collection accounts (paid) from 2001 adversely affected my credit score for the past 7 years which meant the credit card APR's were high and paying down the debt was difficult.  Despite making more than the minimum payments;  making steady payments; and having a stable job (professional) and residency, my credit card/loan accounts are with the now notable BIG three banks.  In January of 2008, one of the banks raised my APR without providing a reason in writing!  I received a letter, but it only stated my APR would increase.  First I was told it was because of an adverse credit report and when I checked into this, it was not accurate.  Over the course of a year, when I requested to have the rate returned to the previous APR or reduced, the request was refused.  BUT, they were more than willing to offer me a ""great deal"" where they would give me another credit card at a low interest rate!!  I refused and when I did the research, I discovered that this was a new tactic being used where the higher interest credit card account would have been closed and opening another account would have adversely affected my credit score (thus further indebting me to that bank)!!!!  This offer occurred when my credit score improved as the collections accounts from 2001 were no longer on my credit report......It is important to note that one of my bank card holders raised my credit limit at a time when banks were lowering credit limits and the bank that raised my APR, never lowered my credit limit......I'm not a high risk, I'm a cash cow and enslaved to the BIG Banks!!

This is my first time applying for a loan at this type of lender.  I am not really sure I have filled out everything properly. The screen indicates n/a under employment which should be explained if I am asking people to invest in me.  I am receiving  Social Security and  I am living with my parents for now which means my monthly living expenses are very low.  I am not dying and will be around to pay back my entire loan ...so please do not worry about that.  I started working when I was 15 years old and always worked until  I suffered some unexpected problems with my health.  Originally I applied for a smaller loan amount because I wasnted to pay of two credit cards  I received when I first started to establish credit.  I guess I was considered a risk with no credit history and I paid an application fee and they charge me an annual fee every month on my statement.   I called them because I feel  I have proven my worthiness and asked for a better card that I could transfer my balance over to with no annual fee.   The offered me a secon card that still charges a large annual fee but rewards me with a few pennies for every dollar I charge on that card.     When I submitted my application here the screen said I was pre approved and could chage my request a higher loan amount they showed on the screen.  I decided I would apply   for a large enough loan to pay off all my debts and have just one monthly payment and be done with credit.   If this loan is funded I plan on making higher payments every month to pay it off sooner and be done with it!  I am not sure if that is good or bad for some one investing in this loan.... but you deserve to know what my intentions are before you make a decision.

The other card has a rate of 29.90% and 18 years to pay off and I currently pay $175. This loan would consolidate and payoff in 3 years.<br/>","credit_card","CA",23.2,0,1,19,0,32681,58.6,35,0,13

We always pay on time and I have a full time job as well - bringing in more than enough income to cover the monthly expenses despite the success of the business.

We have a steady and growing list of clients in St. Augustine, FL and have been adding many new services over the past year that are gaining traction. Again, this is as low risk for any investor as I can imagine...being that I make appx. $80K a year outside of the business, more than sufficient to pay off this loan in the allotted time. Together, our income is above $125K - give or take.<br/><br/>Our new location is in the Medical District of St. Augustine and our target market is the medical base of our community, which, if you acknowledge that health care is booming, this minimizes the risk even more!<br/><br/>We're a safe bet...<br/> Borrower added on 11/12/10 > Special thanks to those who have determined us to be a safe investment...you will not be let down!<br/><br/>As for where we are:<br/>Today, the flooring and server were installed.

Payroll...we always paid contractors and sub-contractors, now we have staff and need to ensure that the money is in our account to do so. Currently we have 1 year of salaries in the bank...<br/>2. Credit Card payments: We have funded about 40% of the expansion using credit cards totalling less than $20K. While about $10K is no-interest credit, the other $10K is not and will be paid with the funds we are requesting.<br/>3. Our monthly debt for business is about $800 for everything - excluding salaries and new equipment. We are already prepaid on the rent 6 months out and plan to pay this way for the duration of the 5 year lease.<br/>4. There is a small amount of money going towards a leased car for the business, since we travel quite a bit. A vehicle wrap is being installed for marketing purposes...this is being done by my husband to reduce costs.<br/>We are about $13K short of our goal...please feel free to send me any questions you have...would like to close this chapter up and get moving with the &quot;making  MORE money&quot; part ASAP.<br/>","debt_consolidation","FL",8.92,0,1,18,0,19505,56.4,27,1,15

So I can be free and clear with them and go back to getting a refund each year. I would also like to pay off my family members that I have borrowed money from.

For example I have been making monthly payments of $150.00 for over a year, and I still only have an available credit line of just $700.00 away from max. This has got to go!!)<br/><br/>My Mom &amp; Dad - $1300.00 who are needing the funds back after a car accident<br/><br/>Grandparents - $950.00<br/><br/>I am currently making these payments per month out of both of my jobs (70 hours per week):<br/><br/>Car Loan - $325.00<br/><br/>Federal Taxes (2010) - have not received bill notice yet, but want to get it paid to avoid more interest!<br/><br/>State Taxes (2010) - have not received bill notice yet, but want to get it paid to avoid more interest!<br/><br/>Credit Card - $150.00 per month (approx $50.00 over Minimum payment amount)<br/><br/>My Mom &amp; Dad - $200.00 per month<br/><br/>Grandparents - $200.00 per month<br/><br/>Should I receive the full amount of my requested loan, it will allow me to cut back to one full time job (45 hours per week). I understand that the loan I am requesting is on the higher side of the interest spectrum, but it is consistent with my current loan interests I am paying. I have been working very hard to improve my financial situation and have succeeded to this point. In fact a year ago, my credit score was in the low 500s and I have now reached the 700s. I have never been late on a payment, and take a lot of pride in that fact!<br/><br/>I again, thank you for your time and consideration in investing in me.

All start up costs have been paid and loan is for capital to make additional loans. If you have read anything about the pawn shop industry you know business is booming. We find ourselves needing more capital to make additional loans - loans that are backed up with collateral that we hold at our shop. The collateral is extremely liquid and is worth a minimum of 165% of the amount we make the loan on. Our interest rate? 180% APR!!!.  56% of Americans live paycheck to paychedk. 20% of the United states population does not have a bank. Lending and credit services are provided to individuals who do not have cash resources or access to credit to meet short term cash needs.The pawn shop will also provide services to people who are unable (or unwilling) to do business with commercial banks. Pawn shop will offer non-recourse loans collateralized by tangible personal property such as jewelry, consumer electronics, tools, sporting goods, musical instruments, etc.  Our current loan average loan amount is $130.00 at an interest rate of 15% per month (180 % APR) The pawn shop will hold the merchandise for 60-90 days, giving the borrower time to repay the loan amount plus interest. Statistically, 15-20% of pawn shops customers do not repay the loan, which allows the pawn shop to generate additional profit (In Addition To The Interest Charges) from the items resale. Since the loan amount is based on 30% of the items market value, defaulted loans can be one of the shops biggest profit generators. A typical loan at a pawn shop is for $100.00 and is secured by a household item worth $200.00. If the loan is not repaid within 30 days the pawn shop gets to keep the item. With the on line auction site E-Bay, disposition of unclaimed loan merchandise is quite easy and profitable.  Additional revenue soures for the shop are:  Check cashing for people to cash checks who do not have a bank.  We purchase gold and jewelry outright from people (gold is trading at an all time high, which has a lot of people selling their old rings and jewelry). WE BUY GOLD!  We provide other financial services such as money orders, money transfers, tax preparation, prepaid phone cards, and Cricket prepaid phone plans.

We are able to make monthly payments on all our cards, but we are having trouble paying more than the minimum payment. One of our biggest challenges is the gasoline prices that continuously go up.

He works as a deputy sheriff for one county, but we moved to another county(houses alot more reasonable in the county we currently live in). In order for him to work in the county we currently moved to, he would have to apply for the Sheriff's Dept. Unfortunately you can't transfer jobs between counties. In the meantime, he is living with relatives to save on gas so we can continue to pay our bills on time. He comes home on the weekends.

I teach music at my wife's school for autism, Celebrate the Children and also work as a recording engineer. I have a steady income. We recently adopted siblings from Kazakhstan (brother and sister). I have been diagnosed with bilateral osteo necrosis of the hip joints. This means that the blood supply to the tips of my femurs was somehow compromised and has left me with lesions of dead bone. Traditional medicine would have me wait until this dead bone collapses and then get  hip replacements. Since the replacements are only good for 5 -7 years, I would have to have this done multiple times, if I live a long life. Last fall I had an ""experimental"" procedure performed on my right hip. The procedure involves drawing my bone marrow and blood, and from that my own stem cells are harvested. Then these stem cells are re-injected into the problem area of the bone to promote re-growth or at least halt the degeneration. This was done by Dr Centeno at the Regenexx clinic in CO. It seems to have been successful. I now need to have this done on my left hip. The procedure cost $8000 and I only have $4000. I have been turned down by my bank and we spent most of our savings on our adoption process. I am experiencing quite a bit of pain and have scheduled the procedure for July- hoping I can raise the money. ","medical","NJ",4.61,0,1,4,0,4093,80.3,12,0,15

This loan is to help my sister, who is a CPA and our parents own their own business.  Neither my sister or I work in the business and have our jobs based in another town.  For our parents business, we have only been listed as an officer and have signature authority on the bank account.  We do not handle any of the cash nor work in the business.  They got behind on their payroll taxes and owe money to the IRS.  In addition, my parents filed personal bankruptcy and the IRS is in the collection process for the payroll taxes.  Under the tax code, the IRS can hold any officer in the company that would have had the ability make payments liable for the payroll taxes.  Thus, the IRS is not only attempting to collect from the business and my parents, but also holding my sister personally liable due to her CPA license.  The impact of the IRS holding my sister liable is huge again because of her CPA license.  If she does not pay the tax, they will file a lien against her as well as revoke her ability to prepare tax returns.  If the IRS revokes that ability, the state can revoke her CPA license, which means that she not only loses her job but also her 1/3 ownership in her accounting firm.  If that happens, she will lose everything that she has worked over 15 years to build.  My sister is well-respected in her area for business advisory services, tax preparation and financial statements.  She LOVES her job and what she does and cannot imagine losing it.  She does not condone the actions of our parents and is caught in an unfortunate legal liability of which she had no control of.  We have attempted to get a business loan with her guarantee from the bank, but they also required a guarantee from the shareholders which was declined due to their bankruptcy.  She is unable to secure a loan personally to cover the full amount of the debt due to prior obligations.  Furthermore, she has resigned her position as an officer and asked to be removed from the bank account to avoid any future potential liability.  My sister is determined to keep her career which she has worked so hard to build and I am doing what I can to help her.  I would deeply appreciate an understanding of the unfortunate circumstances of the situation and any willingness to help.","other","WA",10.56,0,1,6,0,25121,88.4,12,0,18

Our current payment is $3,100 monthly.  We have been approved for a 95% loan, at 3% for thirty years (5 yr arm fixed, then adjustable, max 8% apr for life of loan after five years).  PMI is waived on this loan.  Our new payment, including property tax, would be $1,900, thus a net decrease in monthly mortgage payment of $1,200 if we can move forward with traditional financing.

The terms of the loan were not included except that there was both an interest rate and an APR. Subsequently I confirmed via telephone with a representative that this offer is a closed-end installment loan.  Please understand that I have an offer on the table from Wells-Fargo to consolidate my debt in such a way where my monthly payments are reduced and my loans will be paid off sooner. I am taking this opportunity to see if there is a competitive offer to be found.  I have good credit and always pay more than the minimum due on my credit cards. I would like to consolidate the total amount I owe for (1) convenience of payment, (2) to reduce my percentage rates, and (3) to reduce my revolving credit by moving these debts to an installment payment.   I feel I am an excellent candidate to receive such a loan because I already make regular payments toward my debt; I am merely moving the debt off revolving credit and lowering percentage rates. Additionally, I've worked in the same school system for years and live a stable, sober lifestyle.

I recently had an appraisal completed and it showed a home value of $110,000.  I do not have a HELOC on this home.  I am very fortunate to be provided a company vehicle, for work and personal use, so my personal car is for sale and priced well.  I anticipate selling it quickly, which would leave me without a payment and required insurance.

This happened over the last several years and though I knew she was having some difficulty, I did not realize the extent of her financial woes.    To make a long story short, she accumulated a total consumer debt of $40,000.  I was able to pay off a good chunk with my savings, but she has about $25,000 left.  $18,000 of this is currently in a line of credit with Bank of America that has an interest rate of 18%.  (The other debt I paid was credit card debt with interest rates in the mid to high 20s.)    This loan will be used to help pay off that line of credit.    I recognize that stories of family distress do not necessarily merit extension of credit.  So, here is my financial situation for your review.    I recently accepted a new position at a hospital in Chicago, where I work in hospital administration.  My wife is an attorney and we do not have any consumer debt or car loans.  Our mortgage/tax/insurance payment is ~18% of our monthly gross.  We have about $45,000 in graduate student debt, which is financed, primarily, over 30 years.   That's it for our debt.

About a year ago I  hit a low point in my life and was struggling with everything !!!!!! One of the hardest times for me which gave me the final push I needed to make a change was the fact that I ended a very serious six year relationship. I dedicated myself and everything I had to make it a successful relationship, but after looking back  I feel like I gave myself the short end of the stick for somebody elseâs happiness. Well not ANYMORE!!!  I vowed to myself to do what  makes me happy and to live my OWN life!!!   	For me, Education and Exploring are my biggest passions!!!!  About four months ago I received the opportunity to move to MIAMI and attend FIU where I have the prospect  to study abroad in Germany!!!!  I jumped on this opportunity of a lifetime and have been saving all the money I have made  over the past four months but I'm about 2000 short of reaching my goal to pay for tuition!! I have already applied for loans and grants and have  received as much as I could from them. I need more help so that's why I came to the Lending Club! I have used this program before and Iâm currently at great standing with this program. I have never been late on a payment and I'm a trustworthy member. I know that everyone in the world is struggling and that this is not the best time to ask for help but I know with this money I will  become  happier, wiser, successful, humbled, independent, stronger, and overall an improved individual who can attend school!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I want to buy a house someday and have no intentions on ruining my credit.  Last employed as manager of a local auto repair shop for 1.5 years.  Thank you for the opportunity to better myself and my new career.","car","CA",14.7,0,0,7,0,7120,31.9,9,0,5

We worked hard to rebuild our credit.  I am financially responsibile for our two children, and do receive child support and mainteance at $1800 per month.  I gave a list of my major expenses.

My Situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because I haven't been late on my payments, and I have a stable income since I've been working for the same company for over 25 years. I would like to take advantage of the savings in interest I pay by putting all of my debt into one loan. I have two credit cards and one car loan. The remaining portion of the funds I would like to use to help my daughter. She recently graduated college and with this economy, she has had a hard time getting a job. Her loans are coming out of deferrment and since I was a single-father, I was not able to help pay for her tuition while she was attending, so I feel I could really help her now by lumping a portion of her loans into this.  Below are the balances of my debt:  1. Washington Mutual -$2,500 2. Bank of America -$1,500 3. Local Credit Union (Car Loan) -$5,600  Totals: Approximately $9,600 Remaining: $10,400 to put towards my daughter's school loans.  I feel I am a great candidate for this because, just like my dedication to my work, I am just as dedicated to my financial obligations. Being able to pay off all of this debt for me and my daughter in just 3 years really gives me a sense of hope that we can both be better off fairly soon.

Since I was an out-of-state student, I could not use the same state-paid scholarship I would have been entitled to had I attended an in-state university. However, I felt the added benefit of the out-of-state university outweighed the marginal benefit of staying in-state. I picked up jobs to pay for my rent and tuition.  Now that I am finished, I am looking to consolidate my debt from my two high-interest credit cards charging around ~27% APR.

I believe I am a responsible borrower. I have been living in the same apartment for 3 years now, do not spend frivolously, and pay three times the minimum payment each month.

Only one card has not been cut up and it sits in a block of ice in my freezer so as to be available for *true* emergencies.

We have never been late with a payment in 25 years and we have paid off all our auto loans early.  Thank you.<br/>","car","OR",17.01,0,0,7,0,21594,69.7,15,0,21

My pension plan does not allow more than one loan at a time. I need approximately $18,000 to pay off my current loan. I would like to borrow $18,000 from Lending Club to pay off my current pension plan loan. I will then re-apply for another loan with my pension plan to take advantage of my higher pension plan balance. I will then pay Lending Club back as soon as my old Pension Plan loan is paid off and the new loan is issued.   My employer and I renegotiated my contract for five years adding about $1,000 a month to my income. I now make $128,000 per year. In January 2010 I will be making and addtional $2,500 per year. I  have a clause in my contract that if I am fired, I will be paid three months pay as well as my sick time and vacation time. I have been working here for nearly three years. Due to a signed contract I will be another five years.  It is my intention to repay the loan I borrow from Lending Club within 30 days. This pension plan at my current workplace has a balance of nearly $60,000 and the plan allows for up to 50% loan. In addition I have another $10,000 in my 457(b) (Deferred Comp Plan) which I will tap into to assist me in paying as much of my credit card debt as I can.   I will secure the loan I get from you against the balance in my 401(a) Pension Plan until it is paid in full (again, I believe it should be less than one month).  My overall intention is to pay off about $15,000 in credit card debt. At that point I will only have $4,000 left which I will pay for in six months. I will then be paying off the pension plan loan.  (Chase $5,550.00, Discover $5,250.00 and Chase #2 $4,750.00)  Due to the short term nature of the loan, I am willing to pay up to a 1.5% fee plus an interest rate of up to 10%. My calculations are that Lending Club will make about $420 for a loan of $18,000 for thirty days.  This is a long story but I am trying to pay off all my debt (including my mortgage) in the next 84 months. This will greatly assist me in doing that.  By borrowing against my Pension I will receive the 7% interest being paid to above credit cards. I have excellent credit. I want to keep it that way.  Thank you for your consideration.","credit_card","CA",12.92,0,4,10,0,12204,64.6,39,0,18

I would be extremely grateful if you would help me out of a high-interest credit card situation. I have been with my employer full-time for over 14 years. I usually pay more than the minimum on my credit cards, so if I can consolidate my payments into one I will be able to pay off my debt sooner. I have the money taken straight out of my checking account so I am never late. I paid back all of my student loans and I recently finished paying off my car. I have been successful in having some of my interest rates lowered, although not very much and with revolving interest rates. In any case, I would prefer to give my money to people who are willing to help each other out. I am eager to get out of debt, so again, thank you in advance for your help!<br/> Borrower added on 06/28/10 > Hello and thank you for your questions. I intend to pay back this loan in the same way that I am currently paying back my credit cards. I am able to pay the monthly notes due, but with a flat rate it will be easier to budget over the long term. I applied for the total balance of my debt but the loan offered was for the listed amount, which I accepted. I've never done this before, so I don't know if it would have helped to wait until after payday when my bills are automatically paid and the total debt obviously would be a bit lower. Although I won't be able to completely consolidate all my debts into one, the loan will go to completely pay off the highest interest card and partially pay the next-highest card which is on a revolving interest, so my payments there will actually go a longer way. Even if my total monthly payments out remains the same a larger portion will actually be paying down my debt and I will be debt free much sooner. I use a Discover card for my monthly expenses to keep track of where my money goes and that I pay in full each month. I acquired most of the debt after a long-term relationship breakup over a year ago. My bills suddenly doubled and it took a while for me to sort out my finances and make lifestyle changes that would allow me to be able to handle living on my own on my salary. I had a car payment at the time that I do not have now, so that goes to paying back my debts as well. My job is secure, I know where my money goes each month, and I know that this loan is well within my budget. In fact, it is lower than what I currently pay monthly on my high-interest credit card. Thank you to the people who have funded the loan so far. It is in my best interest as well, so I will make sure that you get your investment back.<br/>","debt_consolidation","TX",11.19,0,1,14,0,13972,20.2,23,0,21

My husband of 11 years and I, are hoping to build a pool in our backyard to enjoy with friends and our two children in this warm climate.  Two years ago, we moved to Arizona from Washington state with a new job, and we love it!  We purchased a home and decided to stay, but now wish we had purchased a home with a pool--something usually secured by your property--and those loans are now few and far between.  We are slightly upside down on our home, so selling and repurchasing a home with a pool isn't a great option for us right now.    We have researched several pool builders and have narrowed it down to two. We would love to take advantage of the end of summer pool discounts offered by pool builders, as we are approaching the slow time of year for new pool builds.  Our current household income is roughly $120,000.  Approximately $7000 is my part time job working at our children's school, and the remainder is my husband's income working for a major telephone service provider.  We are honest, hardworking, taxpaying idividuals who are more than willing to work hard to get ahead.  We currently contribute more than 15% of our income into our retirement accounts, give to charity on a regular basis and have money set aside for emergencies.  We are trustworthy and receive commendations at both our places of employment all of the time--we are nice people who need to cool off in the summer!","home_improvement","AZ",18.34,0,4,5,0,10196,68,38,0,15

Therefore, I have recently become an investor and I am looking forward to investing in an organization that has revolutionized the way we can not only borrow but invest. I had many options that were presented to me to borrow from traditional banks, however Lending Club has proven to be the most innovative and productive way for qualified borrowers to receive loans and also for investors to really increase their portfolios, especially during this tough recession. 560409 added on 10/25/09 > Thanks to all of the investors who have invested money thus far, I greatly appreciate it.","debt_consolidation","CA",13.36,0,2,11,0,2884,96.8,40,1,12

I have an inheritance coming, hopefully soon, which will pay off pretty much every other debt I have. This will free up enough income to pay off the $15,000 with ease. <br/><br/>I have a very steady and secure job where I've been for four years at a very reputable financial news company, I also have excellent credit. Three years ago I had three houses, three cars and two dogs. Then I decided to get divorced, which is expensive, and my mother died, so I was forced to pay taxes and bills on her home, which eventually sold. The money, however, went into the estate, which then went into probate, and is now in the State of Iowa, waiting to be distributed. <br/><br/>I currently pay about $1,000 a month to credit cards. I would like to instead pay $1,000 a month to a lender with a definite end date in sight. You profit from the interest and I save money by not paying on revolving interest. It's a win-win!<br/><br/>Basically, I am a responsible person who just needs a short-term fix so it doesn't turn into a long-term problem.

My monthly income before taxes is around $9,400.00 per month so after my monthly obligations of $2,660.00 leaves me over $6,700 for living expenses, savings and investments.

I have a B.S. in Engineering and have been working within my degree since I graduated college in May 2005. I am successful in what I do and have been a salaried employed by the same company (minus a 5 month hiatus where I quit to work for another company) since I graduated. As a note, my company was more than willing to take me back, thank goodness.   My situation is probably not unique from many other people's however one thing that is unique about me is that I respect and fulfill every debt that I have incurred. I have never had negative comments on my credit report and do whatever it takes to fulfill my obligations including taking second jobs and working as much as 100 hours a week or more.   So you are probably wondering how I got to the point where I am writing this asking for a loan to pay off credit cards. When I married my wife she had a 2 year old son. At that point I had two years of college left. Within these two years, my stepson's father dragged us into court 4 times. Since college he has dragged us into court 2 more times. Attorney's fees stacked up fast and during college we had no other option. Either pay cash and be forced to live on credit or visa versa. Needless to say by the time I graduated and started my career we were already way behind the financial 8-ball and have not been able to recuperate.    I feel probably like most, that there is no way out and no light at the end of the tunnel. I will not try a counseling scam and until now I had no knowledge of peer-to-per lending. I think the concept is brilliant. Why not help others that are willing to help you. Its a win win situation.   I don't feel I have been irresponsible with my credit. I don't have ""toys"", expensive electronics (I salvaged our TV from my neighbors trash), or even go on vacation. Regardless, its to the point now where I need to see a light at the end of the tunnel. If I can see a date on a calendar where I know the debt will be gone that would be a great relief to me and my marriage.  When I was growing up, the one thing I swore to myself was that I was going to be financially stable for my kids. I wanted them to grow up without worrying about money as I did. Not that my kids are old enough to worry about that now but if this continues I know I will fail.  Whether or not you contribute to my loan request thank you for taking the time to read my note.       ","debt_consolidation","NV",11.13,0,1,13,0,7268,24.9,29,1,10

Thank you so much!<br/> Borrower added on 01/23/10 > I wanted to add that in October, I paid two bills late -- just over 30 days late.  I was busy trying to settle my mother's estate and I had my own health issues.  I have not been late on any bill since that time.<br/> Borrower added on 01/24/10 > As noted above, I always paid more than the minimum due...alot more.  So I ended up in this vicious cycle of paying as much as possible in an effort to pay the cards down and then using the cards because I didn't have enough money left.  I know I can afford the $600 plus per month.  This would make it possible not to use any credit card at all.  Plus I would be able to get rid of this debt in 3 years.  I feel if I keep going the way I am, I will never stop treading water.  Thank you again.<br/>","debt_consolidation","IL",8.25,4,1,20,0,30987,48.4,39,0,35

I have been able to keep up with my student loans and credit card debit I have acquired in school.  I have been responsible and have made it a goal to pay off as much of my debt as soon as possible.  I am a good borrower because I have demonstrated financial responsibility and will continue to do so.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to consider our goals and helping us get one step closer to our life together.<br/>","wedding","TX",12.47,0,1,13,0,13389,40.3,13,0,6

I need to put up some stalls for more horses. I currently have five more people wanting to board their horse here at my place, but I need to get stalls built. I will build them myself, and it should only take about a week to get set up. With the instant montly income from those who board horses here, the new stalls will pay themselves off within 6 month's. I think this is a great way to provide a needed service for people with horses, give me a larger income, and really enjoy doing what I love.","other","ID",8.56,0,3,4,0,2000,46.5,4,0,4

I moved from New York City to Seattle to live at home with family during this course to minimize my living expenses because the course does not allow me to work a full-time job.   My plan is to be able to become much more financially stable while continuing my dance career. I know many professional dancers who are financially comfortable as Pilates Instructors, and a number of them encouraged me to follow this line of vocational education. I have a wonderful resume that will serve me well in my job search when I finish my certification. I have experience teaching group fitness, and college-level dance courses. I also have a Master's degree in Modern Dance.   As a professional dancer, there is nothing more  important to me than the opportunity to provide myself meaningful, stable work that interrelates to my artistry. This education means a lot to me! My Pilates Certification will allow me to make much greater wages, and will help me to become financially stable. Therefore, the loan will allow me to undergo the education necessary to put me in a strong position to pay back the loan. Currently, I am in good standing paying back my graduate student loans. My only other credit obligations include an approximate 2600 credit balance that I am currently paying off at two low rates a 6% rate, and 7.3% rate. I have been steadfastly paying those cards down toward my 0 balance goal since 2007, cutting my credit card balances in half since then.   My loan will cover the $1400 remaining balance for my Pilates Certification and $700 of my relocation costs. I am already 1/2 way through the coursework, and have already invested $2000 of my own money in tuition for the program. As for my relocation, I moved from New York City to Seattle to live with family for the summer while I complete the certification in order to reieve myself of rent obligations while I take the coursework. I am not able to work full time until the end of August. Upon completion of the course, I will relocate back to New York, where my dance career is in full swing (two new dances of mine will be shown in major shows in the Fall).   To give you an idea of my work as an artist/ who I am, please see my Artist Bio below:  Graduated from Western Washington University in 2004, Lindsey went on to dance with Khecari Dance Theatre, and then to the University of Utah where she received her MFA. In 2008, she moved to New York, where she has shown work and performed at the New York International Dance Festival, Chen Dance Center's Newsteps Dance Series, and Dance New Amsterdam. She has shown her work in Vienna, Austria and Budapest, Hungary as well at Im_Flieger Vienna and the Solo/Duo Festival in Hungary. Lindsey was also a Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Utah, and was given a stipend for a full year of international research in the Balkans, interviewing politically and economically displaced dancers of the Balkan region.  Lindsey co-directs GoGoVertigoat Dance Project (www.gogovertigoat.org). They have shows upcoming at BoCoCa Arts Festival in Brooklyn, Dance New Amsterdam's fall Raw Material, and Movement Research's Judson Church.

My financial situation: (explain why you are a good candidate for paying back this loan) I feel that I am a good candidate of paying back this loan because I have experience, integrity, and the innovation in not only helping repay my investors but most importantly putting the food on the table for my family.  My wife and kids are my life and without them I would be nothing.  I have not been late on a loan or missed a payment for 7 years since I first entered college!  Combined with my 8 years in the services industry and being a top rated business man throughout my years, I feel that I am a great candidate for this loan.  I really need to help pay off these debts and especially for the ones that I love, and with the power of that love, and YOUR HELP, we will enable the opportunity save money, pay off our debts, and setup a plan to place my children through college.

Including my housing it is $1,099. I do not have any credit card debt, no collections, and no bankruptcies. Conventional banks do not help people that are in my unique situation. My business is a cash business, and I have not applied for a lot of credit accounts, and the banks look down on that. I do not have a lot of open credit accounts because I do not really believe in credit cards.  I like to pay cash if I have it and that way I avoid getting into debt. I have been very responsible with credit and do not like to just open up accounts for the heck of it. Apparently this is not something that banks like, because they are saying that I do not have a lot of credit accounts. I only have 3 but that is enough for me. They want people to open up so many accounts so that you can drown in debt, but I have steered clear of that scenario.

I love what I do, have a college degree in my field with no tuition debt, and am so thankful to be gainfully employed in this still difficult environment.    I have been with the company for nearly ten years and have been promoted several times over the past 5 years.  Getting promoted is not just about successful results, it's also about mobility.  I have moved for my job 6 times since 2002, which has been great because all moves have meant more money and greater responsibility.  Even though I received relocation assistance for 3 of the 6 moves, it always involves more money than you get.  The other 3 moves I did voluntarily to be closer to my territory, but with no financial assistance.  The additional out of pocket needs have slowly crept up on me in the form of high credit card debt. <br/><br/>On July 1, 2010 I am moving yet again.  This is an exciting time, albeit an expensive move as my new district is Boston, Massachusetts proper.  This recent promotion brings with it a raise in salary and a company vehicle.  I plan to use this additional income to aggressively pay off my debt and will continue to work to improve my financial situation.  I want nothing more than to pay off this credit card debt and say goodbye to exorbitantly high interest rates. <br/><br/>I think it is genius to have a forum where I can put some money into someone's pocket in return for a loan that will help me get rid of the plastic debt!  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration and rest assured I am a worthwhile and sound investment.<br/> Borrower added on 05/28/10 > Additional notes:<br/>I have never defaulted on a loan or financial obligation.  I want to add an additional note to alleviate any potential concerns investors may have about my ability to repay the loan here on Lending Club.<br/><br/>In the unlikely event that I found myself unemployed and without a steady stream of income, I would borrow against my 401k retirement account to pay back my loan here on Lending Club.  As of today (5-28) I have $90,000 between my 401k/savings retirement account.  <br/><br/>Thanks again for considering me as your next investment.<br/>","debt_consolidation","MA",7.78,2,0,10,0,20270,48.7,15,0,21

The loan will help with these purchases/acquisitions, and I am still taking care of other costs such as insurance (about $1000/yr), merchant account, broadband service, etc. Based on my research and projection (estimates), estimated yearly revenue for a good scenario comes to $45,000 on the machine, and estimated yearly expense is about $25,000 (machine cost is not included in this).Thus Net-Revenue is $20,000 out of which I can &quot;deduct the machine cost easily&quot; to payoff the loan within 2 to 3yrs (without even having to use my personal paycheck).The loan will already be taken out of my account, so technically its already coming-out from my incoming paychecks- (and the above revenue would replace my paycheck :-) ).<br/>-- I would be highly honored to have you fund my loan;I am a very promising entrepreneur (as you can see through my concise summary),and funding my loan will get me one step closer to setting up my own DVD/Film rental small business.Thank you.<br/>","small_business","IL",1.92,0,3,3,0,6265,81.4,6,1,5

My financial situation:  I have a solid 9 year credit history with no negative marks. I opened my first credit card in college and unlike many students developed my credit history wisely. Post-graduation, of my 6 revolving balances, I've paid off my two student loans, and have 3 revolving credit cards, the highest balances being $8400 most of which consists of a purchase and auto repairs for a car I no longer use (public transportation is great for wallet and environment!).

I have health insurance coverage and do not plan any large expenses in near future. I always pay my bills first before all else, and my credit history reflects this.

A little about me personally I hold a business degree from the University of Washington Foster School of Business.  I have never had a late payment.  Last year I maxed out my 401k and Roth IRA.  Overall I would say I'm very disciplined and financially responsible.

I make enough money to pay off all my expenses every month and with the approximately $800 in surplus, I make a second payment on my credit cards in the middle of the month. I am also about 2-3 months away from completely paying off my car - but I am in a long-distance relationship so I have additional expenses of gas, oil changes and hotel rooms.    I also I moved back home with my parents 3 months ago to help speed up the pay-off process- this is why I have no housing expenses.

He allows me to get all the over time that I'm willing to sacrifice my time for, in which case I usually put in over 50 hours a week. In which case, my checks average 380 a week. Also, for every ASE certification I pass, which I plan on passing more, I get a 75 cent raise. So I plan on passing at least 3 more before finding a better paying job in my field, which will make my weekly payment that much more significant.  My rent is only 325.00 a month, utilities are split with two other roomates(averaging about $75 per month, per person). My car insurance, health insurance, and cell phone bills are covered by my parents so I do not carry that financial burden. So two weeks out of the month take care of my living expenses, while the other two weeks can be used to pay off any debt I have.

However, because of the high cost of rent in our area, we won't be able to make more than the minimum payments on our credit cards for 6 months (when we move to a cheaper apartment), and the amount above the minimum that we will be afford when we move will be much lower than we'd like.

The desire to help and support those in need, whether animal, plant, or person, and the wildness I harbored in my soul, stayed with me long after I escaped the challenging circumstances I grew up in. I eventually channeled those youthful traits into a career in urban education that I love beyond words, even though I endured many hardships along the way, especially financial, in order to find it. The loan I am seeking is for the purpose of consolidating debt I incurred in my twenties and early thirties as I struggled to put myself through college and graduate school, and then tried to find stable employment. Now that I am fortunate to be in a professional position with a great deal of job security, I want control over my financial landscape to be included amongst my accomplishments. Having a single installment loan with one payment due each month and a reasonable interest rate will offset the stress caused by making multiple payments on past debts with high interest rates. Less stress in this area of my life will allow me to have greater focus on those areas that matter most, like helping those I serve become productive, educated citizens able to break the damaging cycles that have wreaked havoc on their lives, those of their loved ones, and their communities.

However, as I watched my loan money increase through individuals' investments, I began to feel a strong sense of accountability to this community of lenders and borrowers. Because I work in social justice and community revitalization, I connect personally with the concept behind Lending Club. I hope others that use this site have an equal level of respect for those that have chosen to funnel their own earnings into someone's loan request. Failure to do so would amount to a shameful act of failing the community as a whole.

The card in question, issued by Bank of America, is one that I have held for ten years. It always had a 9.9% fixed APR, and regularly offered attractive lower-rate balance transfers, so I used it over time to consolidate debt.   I've never missed a payment, on that card or any other debt. Bank of America recently decided, though, that it would increase its rates. My 9.9% fixed APR jumped to 22.65% variable -- and because I get my statements online, I missed the ""opt out"" notice. I've requested that the card be closed, but it will stay open until paid off, and since the balance is so large, that'll be a while.  So, I'm looking to get $25,000 as a fixed-rate loan from LendingClub so that I can pay off the card and let it fade into history.  I have plenty of steady, W2 income to support repayment of this loan, including a salaried position in information security, several long-term rental income streams, and monthly pay as an Air Force Reserve officer.","credit_card","VA",19.27,0,0,20,0,149527,72.6,53,0,12

I am obtaining this loan because I have accrued some revolving debt the past several months which I will explain throughout this posting.  I would much rather pay interest to people rather than to the credit card companies so that is why I am using lending club.     I bought a brand new home some time ago and it became time to do the backyard.  The yard is huge and took a lot of time and money to complete but it is now done.  I am also getting married very soon so we not only had to pay for the backyard but we also had to pay for the remainder of our wedding.  Needless to say, our expenses have been very high these past few months but everything is now paid for and it is business as usual now and time to pay off the debt.     With this loan, I am going to pay off my revolving credit card debt and a loan I already have with Lending Club.  I obtained a loan in January of this year with Lending Club in the amount of $16,000 with a monthly payment of $530.  I have paid that loan down to a balance of $6990 in 9 months so I have averaged paying over $1,000 a month each month on that loan.  You may ask why I haven't been paying the minimum on the Lending Club loan and using the cash I would save by not paying extra on Lending Club to pay for my expenses on the backyard and wedding.  The answer is that the two main credit cards that I have been using have the introduction rate of 3% but that goes away in November so it made sense to do what I have been doing.     The lending club loan I referenced above I obtained due to a vehicle.  Unfortunately, I made a couple poor choices in college in changing vehicles and kept on rolling negative equity into cars that I purchased.  When I worked for my company prior to this, I bought a new Dodge vehicle and rolled in quite a bit of negative equity.  With my prior company, they did not provide me with a company car so I had to use my own vehicle.  I put 30,000 miles on the vehicle in one year and then I left that company to come to my current company and they provide me with a company vehicle.  I had to sell my Dodge with a ton of miles in a awful economy with a lot of negative equity in it to start with.  I had to get rid of it way below blue book and took a huge loss.  Live and learn.     I am a Marketing Representative with a Insurance Company with a base salary of $77,500.  In addition to the salary, I receive monthly commissions based on performance and year to date through Septempber I have made $79,000 so far and I project to make $107,000 for the year at least.  I have been with this company for a year and a half and have complete job security.  I have a company car so I have no car payment, no insurance, no maintenance, and no fuel expenses.  Also, I work from home so my company pays for my cell phone, home phone, and cable internet.  With all of those things, that adds up to be a lot of money that I save each month for expenses.  I also have a side job with a friend that I make $150/month in as well.     Income:   $9000/month salary   Expenses:   Lending Club:  From my calculations, it will be $640/month or so with this loan amount. Student Loan:  $150 Mortgage:  $2250 (split 2 ways with my fiancee) Utilities/Food/Entertainment:  Varies, but $500 is probably about average   As you can see, my income is great versus my expenses.  I have no late or missed payments on my credit report and never will.  My credit score is lower than usual just because I have the revolving debt on it right now and that impacts the score.  Before this debt was on the reports a few months ago, my credit scores were all around 720.    Thank you very much for reading this very long posting and considering this loan.

I'm a bit confused why it was decided is all.  Thank you all for your help!   This concept is really interesting and neat.<br/>","moving","NY",3.12,0,0,5,0,3148,29.7,13,0,11

These credit cards/lines were opened to help fund my graduate education at New School University in New York City. Since graduating in 2006, I have increased my income by $30,000, which indicates to me that my graduate education was the correct decision. I'm grateful for that opportunity and the rewards I continue to reap from my Master's degree. Yet, in my three years since graduating, I have not been able to make an impact on my debt. Recently, I suffered a miscarriage, an emotionally devastating personal moment; this occurrence, though, has inspired me to pay off my debt in the next few years so that my future children will have a debt-free, budget concious mom. Further, paying off this debt quickly will allow me to continue my education to the PhD level. My plan is to attain my PhD in literature in order to become a director of an English department.

I have immaculate credit and I didn't want to let my credit cards amounts get out of hand. They advertised i could get a loan as low as 4.99% but when I called they refused my application because ""I had not established enough credit history with their business."" It blew my mind since I had been discover card member since 2003 or so and had made every payment on time. I begged them to loan me the money because I knew it would help me tremendously with repaying my high intrest rate credit card debt I had accumulated through college and before landing my job after graduation. They finally agreed to finance the loan for $10,000 at 14.99%! Just below my lowest credit card APR at the time. It was disapointing to me because I have such a good credit score. Either way I have paid a little more than the min every month on time, but I can't stand the fact my intrest rate is so high and I have 6 more years of this!  I took up a second job over the summer and have some cash stashed to pay a chunk of but I still can't stand the fact my intrest is so high. I am coming to lendingclub to take out a loan on the remaining principle in hopes of a lower intrest rate and closer pay off date. Please help!","credit_card","IL",17.23,0,2,9,0,2296,9.3,19,0,7

I fell into the credit card trap in college 14 years ago, and as I grew in my career, I intended to pay them off.

They have been unreasonable in not budging on bringing the rate back down.  Any extra money that was going to be used to pay down the College debt ended up going to all the extra interest on that one card.  I have a solid salary, I own my own home, have a solid career with 10 years experience in my field, and can easily make the monthly payment on this loan.

We currently pay approximately $1,300 / month for childcare but in June that will cut in half as our middle child begins school.  We also took advantage of the home buying credit to purchase a larger house in December of 2009 and even though we got a great deal we still had to purchase several major appliances and out of pure convenience used high interest credit cards to do so.<br/><br/>We're finally rounding the turn and getting past the cost of daycare and diapers, not to mention the 3 surgeries to have tubes placed in the little ears and having tonsils removed.

My well staffed small business offers personal training for adults, kids and teens, group classes, boot camps, intensive's, workshops, and much more. We have established ourselves in our community and we are known for outstanding service, incredible programs, dedication to our clients, as well as having great marketing and brand awareness.<br/><br/>This loan will be used to continue to grow what has already been put in place. After seven great years I know we are capable of even more volume and bigger numbers. The demand for what we offer is high and how we do it is different than our competitors. I know this is why we grew during the recession when most other fitness programs went out of business.<br/><br/>Specifically this money would go to several advertising programs, with a good portion of it going to a new website. I think a well organized web site is key for growth. My vision for the new site is one that has exceptional navigation, a clean design, clear content, video's of what we do and how we are different, as well as easy to fill out sign up forms and effortless payment options. Since visibility is key I want to purchase and sell our custom tee shirts. Our designs are easy to read and look great, ensuring they are often worn by clients around town. To date these tee's have given us a great deal of advertising while making our current clients feel special. The balance of the money will be used for new promotional pieces, local advertising, and PR. <br/><br/> We have always paid our employee's, independent contractors, and service providers on time. We have never had an outstanding bill or billing issue. We are in good standing with our bank as well as with our two business credit cards, never having a payment or credit issue. We have successfully and with ease rented offices and studio space. We have worked closely with local cities and been approved to rent space in city owned property. <br/><br/>In the seven years I have ran my company I have always had solid cash flow and never needed to take other work.

I want to payoff as much as possible and then close the CC accounts.  I know that closing the CC accounts may hurt my FICO a little in the short run, but I want to close them nevertheless.  Purpose of loan: Payoff highest-rate credit card debt, which is currently 28-31.5%.  Getting another loan with a lower interest rate will improve my monthly cashflow.  My progress:  Today I have 14 credit lines with a revolving credit balance of 150K and utilization of 99% (result of recently paying down 2 CC accounts anc closing them).   My financial situation:  I have accumulated too much credit card debt and continue to work to pay it all off.  I have a perfect payback history: no missed payments or delinquent accounts.  My payback history in my credit files is perfect, but I have let some credit card rates get too high by some inattention on my part.  I opened some credit cards with low introductory rates on balance transfers but because I was late on a couple of the payments by literally 1-3 days, the credit card companies jacked up the rates.  Those initial low interest rate offers (e.g., 0 to 3.99% for 12 months) for balance transfers were tempting, but came back to haunt me.  My credit rating/score looks poor becasue of my high percent of borrowing vs. limit.  I've always paid back and will continue to.  I have no delinquencies or negatives on my credit reports and I'm committed to it staying that way.  Any form of negative mark on my credit report is not an option for me.  If my loan is funded, I will immediately pay down my highest interest debt .  I'm fortunate to be in a situation where I'm earning a good income, but need to get my high-rate credit card debt eliminated in the short term, and continue to work to be free of all credit card debt in the next 3-4 years.

Instead, four days later, I received an email from LC stating that the loan had been denied due to incomplete paperwork. I was shocked so I contacted them and fortunately got in touch with the person who denied my loan. I asked him that how come they didn't contact me when they were unable to obtain completed paperwork from me even after I had sent them everything via emails (I have the records to prove it). Their response was that the matter will be investigated and I would be contacted within 24 hours. A few days ago, I received another email requesting the paperwork. This time I sent PDF files and also faxed the documents. I spoke to them last night and they said that I needed to re-list the loan.  They confirmed that for the re-listed loan, they have already verified all information including employment, salary, and federal tax returns and if the loan is funded again, things would go smoothly.

I had an account with Bank of America which I payed off in full.  Apparently they added finance charges of $3.98 which accrued between me getting the bill and paying off the balance.  They never sent me another statement and I had no idea that I had such minimal balance.  No one from the company contacted me and I didn't realize any of this was going on until I pulled a credit report and saw this.  I payed off the balance and asked the company for some answers and got no where.  This has been a very frustrating sitution and I hope it doesn't affect my chances of getting fully funded.

My significant other was hospitalized last year and had to have major surgery to keep him from going paralyzed. He has been unemployed for the past year and a half due to his surgery. All of my income has had to go to our mortgage and bills. Due to this I have reached the limit on all of my credit cards. I purposely have kept my limits low, so my total debt is not too significant. I would like to be able to pay off these high interest rate cards and finally be able to gain some ground. My significant other is now employed and we both want nothing more than to start paying off our debt. I have been with my wonderful employer for over 2 years and have been consistently employed since the age of 18. It is high time I start using my money wisely, but will never be able to do so until I can pay down my debt. This seems like a wonderful program and I would love to be able to be able to turn around and invest when I can financially do so.  Thank you for your consideration. You have no idea how much this would impact my day to day life as well as my future.  Best regards, Swimmer","debt_consolidation","CA",10.61,0,0,5,0,1487,92.9,8,0,8

Unfortunately I had to use my credit cards about 5 years ago when I was laid off by my previous employer who told me it was temporary and to just wait a week. That week turned into 4 months before I realized my cards were getting maxed out and took a different job. Since then I have not made as much progress paying down my debt as I would like. While I have made some progress, it's not enough, I want to be debt free in 5 years.<br><br>  I recently purchased a house and rent out several of the rooms to help with my income. I also recently sold my expensive and newer financed cars and instead now have two older used cars with much smaller loans/payments and only 3 year terms (both with about 2 years left, one partially through LendingClub).<br><br>  My accounts, approximate balances, and APRs are:<br> Direct Merchants: $4200 (28.99%)<br> Chase: $3400 (31.99%), $3300 (17.24%), $1200 (29.24%)<br> Citi: $2100 (29.99%)<br> Sears: $2300 (28.99%)<br> Merrick: $2000 (22.99%)<br> Capital One: $1900 (16.15%), $1800 (12.4%), $1000 (19.8%), $450 (14.4%)<br> Best Buy: $700 (29.99%)<br> HSBC: 300 (29.99%)<br><br>  I am aware that some of these cards have lower APRs than the loan I am requesting, however they have annual fees that are expensive, and having just one payment per month will be less stressful for me and worth the few extra dollars to me. I plan on immediately closing all of these accounts except one for emergencies. I am aware that it will damage my FICO score, but I don't want or need any of these accounts or the fees.<br><br>  I have been working for my employer for about 4 years now and it is a full time and very stable position, and I enjoy it very much. <br><br>  I have always made all my payments on time except one in 2006 which was accidentally not updated when I moved and did not give the bank the right address.

Finally, they extended a line of credit for what they call &quot;Instant deposit&quot; which allows me to mail checks to them but credit my account in the meanwhile.  <br/><br/>As a result, my credit report FICO score took a 40 point hit from around 700 to 660, resulting in my disappointing &quot;F1&quot; score here on LendingClub.  My other LendingClub account before this was rated MUCH more favorably (it was a B or C score I think?) and nothing has changed much in terms of my overall credit standing.<br/>","credit_card","VA",17.78,0,2,15,1,17419,57.9,37,0,15

This loan will be used to consolidate a high interest credit card and to make final payments on two 2008 pre-season merchandise invoices.      I have owned and operated this growing adventure sports business for over 18 years. The business has been located on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe for that entire time. We carry Hobie, Wilderness Systems, Perception Kayaks, sailboats and stand-up paddleboards etc half of the year and then we add winter gear skis, snow shoes and soft goods for the second half of the year. This growing business consists of a retail store front location on the busiest intersection on the north shore. We also have an outdoor lake front space in back of shop that is next to public beach park for our kayak and sailboat rentals. There is not a better location on the lake for what we do. We also offer online sales. Our third quarter of 2008 was our best quarter to date with a net of 240,000.00. We sold more kayaks and sailboats than ever before and also increased our rentals and guided tour business.  One reason I seek this loan is to pay off the remaining kayak inventory. In the kayak world you must order pre-season to have boats in stock while “in season” estimating exactly how many you will need is impossible so we always carry some extras throughout the off season. This is also necessary in order to have off season sales (we sold three $800 kayaks last week).    I am a healthy 51 year old husband and father. I have been married for 27 years. I have two wonderful children ages 20 and 26. My wife is a special needs school teacher and I also have a part time job that pays me a salary of just over $500 a week. I can work the business during the day and work my salary job at night when I am needed. I can be trusted to pay back this loan in a timely consistent manner. My goal is to pay this loan back by the end of the summer. This business has grossed (in one day) $12,500.00 the amount of this loan request.

Well unfortunately I had my credit card eggs in a small basket. Even though both accounts had over 8000 in credit limits between them and had zero balances they chose to close one of them and reduce the credit limit on the other to 500.00. They said it was a corporate decision based on the WAMU accounts. While I respect their decision it also hurts my credit rating. I should have diversified more and had more cards but I don't like having lots of credit cards. The reason I have the debt I do have is from medical bills for my dog. Also the inquiries I have are from when I was getting quotes to lower my car insurance.Other then that I am a stay at home and watch a movie kind of girl. Drive the same car for years. And put your max into your 401k each month.Now since I want to consolidate the debt I do have and put my score back where it should be I thought Lending Club would be the good way to go. Get a manageable loan, and improve my credit score. While I am new to Lending Club, I do have a paid off loan with Prosper, it was some of the lenders there way back who said Lending Club was a better way to go.   I also want to add I am a renter, but in South Florida that's a good thing right now. I have lived in the same house for almost four years and don't have an overpriced house to worry about. Thank you for taking the time to look at my listing. Have a great day.","debt_consolidation","FL",8.6,0,1,7,0,20994,75.8,10,0,15

My annual income before taxes is about $62,000 excluding bonus.  I am working towards my PE (Professional Engineer) license after which I hope will to be earning at least $70,000.   My biggest drain for now is supporting my younger brother's dental school expenses and supporting my parents. I send them about $1300 pm which leaves me with $250-$350 of savings for emergency fund after all monthly expenses (let me know if you want to know the details).    My wife is dependent on me for now.  She has got admission in an excellent MS course at a great school which is ranked # 25.  She also got scholarship of about $13,000. I hope that by next fall she will be able to help me in paying off this loan.  I foresee that within a year, I'll be better off financially.  As my brother is about to graduate and also my wife will be working.Itâll be really great if I could get a rate less than 10%.  Let me know if you need any additional information.

I am trying to refinance my mortgage at today&rsquo;s prevailing rates.  I want to move from a 30 year 5.625% fixed rate to a 15 year 3.85% fixed rate.  The 15 year mortgage will help me build equity and pay down my home faster and save over $226K in interest. The 30 year mortgage has interest of $310K and the 15 year mortgage has interest costs of $84K. The difference in the monthly payment is only $258.  (New Payment $1,927 vs Old Payment $1,669).  I have tried getting a refinance on my existing mortgage but the mortgage companies say that I can not get a loan until I get the HELOC closed and paid.  At this time, I am unable to pay the $25K off.    <br/><br/>I am a solid candidate for a loan.  I have worked in the Accounting field for 12 years.  I currently work as a Financial Analyst for the #3 commercial real estate company in the US doing the Accounting for 8 Washington D.C. commercial office buildings.  I have over 5 years in commercial real estate.  My yearly salary is $71K.  In addition, my wife works at a nursing home in a management position.  She makes a little over $58K yearly.  We can comfortably make monthly payments.  We clear about $3K monthly after expenses.  I have been paying off debt the last three years and we currently have no credit card bills or student loans as of October 2010.  We decided to consolidate our $40k in credit cards and made sizable payments monthly over the last 2 years making our last payment in October.  Outside of the Bank of America HELOC, we have 2 car loans that were refinanced in July 2010.  Our payments and loan amounts are as follows:  2005 Camry $309 / $13,049 and 2007 Acura $211 / $11,895.  <br/><br/>We have never missed a payment for over 6 years and we are very diligent in improving our credit score.  We will make every payment on time every month.  <br/><br/>Our monthly financial snapshot looks like this:<br/><br/><br/>My Net Income	           $4,238<br/>Wife Net Income	 3,605<br/><br/>Total Net Income           $7,843<br/><br/>Expenses<br/><br/>Mortgage 	           $1,669<br/>RE Taxes		   581<br/>Condo HOA Fees	   250<br/>PSEG 			   143<br/>Sprint (Cell phone)	   121<br/>Insurance (Home)             125<br/>Camry			   309<br/>Acura			   211<br/>EZ Pass		     50<br/>Gas			   200<br/>Insurance (Car)		   139<br/>TD Bank Loan		   177<br/>Daycare	               880<br/><br/>Total Expenses	           $4,855<br/><br/>Net Income	           $2,988<br/> Borrower added on 11/09/10 > The six inquiries were made this year.  I refinanced both my car loans from higher interest rates / monthly payment amounts in July 2010.  The car payments for the Camry and the Acura before the refinance was $537.35 and $580.92 respectively.  The new monthly payments became $309 and $211 for both cars.<br/><br/>I refinanced a healthcare loan in August that carried high revolving interest into a more manageable loan with an 9% interest rate vs. 25.99%.  This made my loan payment $176 vs. $377. <br/><br/>I applied for a refinance at two different mortgage companies in September &amp; August but they were not fruitful due to the open HELOC loan.  <br/><br/>The revolving debt of $26K is mostly the $25K HELOC from Bank of America.  <br/><br/>I will make this loan a wonderful investment for you.  Thru this loan, we'll both win, you'll get a great rate, I'll get the loan which will make my refinance possible and I can eventually save over $200K in interest.<br/><br/>Thank you for your support.<br/>","debt_consolidation","NJ",18.55,0,6,10,0,26078,91.5,43,0,13

I will be more than happy to clarify. First I am asking for a loan to consolidate my debt, I'm currently paying on about 8 different cards every month and my interest rate on some of them is really high; so I would like to consolidate them all into one loan with one interest payment. As of now I am currently paying about $525.00 a month on my credit cards, at the end of august that will drop to about $300.00 a month because I will be done with 3 of them. My goal is to pay off my debt as soon as possible I always pay on time and more than the minimum. The reason I need the loan is not because I can't afford to pay but to simply pay it off faster. With the current plan in place of me making payment of $230.00 for 3 years I will be able to make additional payment a month to pay this loan off faster. So to answer your question I do plan on paying this loan off early, hopefully in about 2yrs or less. I know that credit is tough to get now days because of the economy and  lending money now carries a higher risk for the lender, but I have never defaulted on any of my credit cards, nor on anything thing else. I always pay all of my bills on time and if possible I pay some in advance long before they are due. Also another thing is that I work for the City of North Richland Hills, I am currently employed there as a Detention Officer, it is a civil service job so it does take a lot for someone to be laid off or fired. I make the same if not more money every month, but I never make less. Currently I&rsquo;m making about $1932.00 net a month the only payments that I have are my monthly rent of $459.00 Utilities about $150.00 and my cell phone and internet of about $135.00 and currently the $525.00 on my credit cards. Once I consolidate my cards into one loan I will be more than able to pay for this loan. Currently I also attend Tarrant County College at the end of the fall semester I will be testing for the Police Officer Position my chances of getting hire on as a Police Officer are very high due to the fact that I already work here, so once I become and Officer my pay will also go up and that will allow me to pay of my loan even faster. In the chance that I don't become an Officer this year I still plan on paying off this loan in Less than 2yrs. I hope that I have answered any and all questions so that you all will be able to make a more informed decision. Thank you for your time and show of interest in me, if you have any more questions I will be more than happy to answer them. Thank you again.<br/>","other","TX",12.37,0,0,10,0,6547,57.4,12,0,3

I already have film makers who are ready to rent the equipment as soon as I receive the funding and am able to go purchase everything needed.<br/>","other","NY",3.3,0,5,2,0,2403,72.8,4,0,6

Looking back I should have listed a loan for more than I did the last time.  I did not pay off one credit card which was at 2.99%, but I was able to double the payments every month and had planned to have the card paid off the same time the Lending Club loan was paid.  Since that time however, with the economy the way it is, I have had to cut back on the payments I make on the credit card and I will no longer be able to have it paid off in 3 yrs.  I'm finding that it is much easier to budget if I had just one &quot;loan&quot; payment per month.  This 24,000 will enable me to pay off my 3 yr Lending Club loan, the dept credit cards (which both have small balances) and the big credit card amount and still have money left to cover incidentals and adding more to my savings each month.  I realize this will add an additional 2 years to my planned retirement, but then again, the economy might improve in a couple of years and I will be able to make bigger payments to pay this loan off earlier.

Countrywide promised that money would always be available to me.  Shortly after, they froze my HELOC and I cannot get to my own money.   I am seeking a loan of $ 5000 to use as the hospital bills trickle in, so that I can keep household and business expenses separate.

My firm is very entrepreneurial and part of its culture is that partners are not paid a salary.  In essence, partners in my firm are paid on a commission basis based on the amount work they do and the amount of business they bring in.  Because partners do not get paid until our clients pay their bills, a new partner must wait at least two months before seeing his/her first check.  Per industry standard practices, the first month of work will not be billed until the beginning of the next month and clients have 30 days (i.e., the beginning of the following month) to pay their bills.  Thus, work done in November is not billed until the beginning of December and is not paid until the beginning of January.  As a result, my next paycheck will not be until next January.  My wife and I are seeking to adopt from a foreign country, which is a long and expensive process.  (It usually takes a few years and costs $20,000 or more per adoptive child.)  As result, we have not been able to save as we would like and we are facing a few more expenses in the next few months.  Although we have already spent most of what we need to complete the adoption, there will be a some expenses (such as international plane tickets and hotel expenses to bring our child home) to pay when the time comes.  My current income is about $132,000 per year.  Because of marketing and other advantages that law partners have over non-partners (i.e., clients are more comfortable doing business with and paying higher rates for partners), I expect my annual income to increase to at least $165,000 per year once I make partner.  I need a loan now, however, to secure the income I will need over the next few months and to give me some time to build my savings and even out the inevitable up-and-down cycles that occur when you depend on commission-based income.  (I would rather get a loan than borrow from my credit cards because credit cards are just too darned expensive.)  One note on the prospects for the legal market:  I have developed legal expertise in different areas that normally exhibit different market trends.  I do a lot of work in complex commercial and employment litigation in federal courts, and I have extensive experience in bankruptcy litigation.  Both litigation and bankruptcy are countercylical (i.e., the work goes up as the economy goes down).  I also advise numerous tax exempt organizations, such as charities, trade associations, and political organizations.  This work tends to grow with the economy and tracks normal business cycles.  Finally, my firm has several competitive advantages, including our location in Washington, D.C.  Federal government services are recession-proof and the businesses in this area (and that come from around the country to lobby or do business here) continue to grow even in the middle of a recession.  That and our ability to deliver high-quality service for a more affordable price makes our firm very attractive even during down times in the economy.  All of these factors mean that our work (and my part of it) should continue to be steady regardless of the economic conditions affecting the country as a whole.  That in a nutshell is my request.  I am looking forward to working with you to make it fruitful both for me and for your investors.","small_business","VA",15.16,0,0,8,0,134025,67.9,16,0,21

I had invented a small tool with potentially large consumer market.  This tool 'almost' made it into the Home Depot as well as several other regional retail chains, but the economic downturn stopped it cold.   I have made regular payments on that loan and it's down to $15,765.  I pay my credit card bills on time except for two late payments due to delivery. In the face of the defeat of my invention business and the 60%+ contraction of the local construction industry from five years ago, I have built up this new business on a shoestring.  This business is making money and it is the field-tested 'proof of concept'.  I now have a very public profile here locally, due to newspaper articles and a radio show appearance.  I have a great reputation as a builder and a strong referral network of happy customers.  My word is my bond.<br/>","small_business","CA",10.43,0,0,6,0,12982,81.1,16,0,21

The interest rates on my cards aren't that bad, as my credit score and history are excellent, but lately with the current financial tom-foolery going on I've been thinking a lot about our banking system.  I decided if someone is going to make a profit lending ME money, I'd rather it be real people rather than a bunch of rich fat-cat in a fancy office skimming off the top.  So, I'm collecting my credit card debt (the debt that I don't have at 3.9% fixed for the life of the balance) into one payment.  I take my debt very seriously, and have had revolving credit lines in good standing since I was 16 (a $300 balance capital one credit card!).  I have been with my current job since 1998.  My bills primarily consist of a car loan, and a few credit card bills.  My wife and I have housing paid for by our company (she works with me), so we have a very good debt to income ratio and put as much as we can into savings every month.    I've considered using our savings to pay down debt, but up until recently we were making more in investments than we were paying in interest.  We'll see what the future holds.  I'd pay off corporate debt before I'd pay off this LendingClub loan (which only has a three year term, which is a fairly insignificant amount of time in the big picture).

If granted the loan requested, I will be using the funds to pay off 2 of my credit card balances, most of which was incurred during Graduate School.  During the credit crisis, Bank of America increased my APR to 24%!  With an APR like that, I'll never get the balances paid down.  I'm working very hard to pay down my debts so I can begin saving and working towards the purchase of a home!  I'm incredibly reliable and have never defaulted on any debt.  Please consider helping me out. You will not be disappointed!  I am an accountant working towards my CPA. My job is incredibly stable and my income is more than sufficient to cover payments.  I am simply trying to take steps in the right direction to manage my debt effectively. Thank you again! I look forward to working with you. 551796 added on 10/07/09 > ANSWER TO StocksMan QUESTION:  Originally, I had hoped to consolidate all of my revolving debt, with the exception of 2 items which are interest free (GE Financial and Dell totaling approximately $1200.00).  However, given the interest rate I have been offered through Lending Club, it will only be beneficial for me to consolidate approximately $7,000.00 of my revolving debt (the 2 Bank of America CC) as the interest rate on these two cards is quite high.     Though you did not ask, I thought it may be helpful to understand where the majority of my debt came from.  I put myself through undergrad and grad school, and came out with VERY little debt in terms of school loans.  However, while in school, many of my living expenses (those expenses I could not cover by the income I earned while working) went onto my CC.  After graduating I was able to pay down my CC debt significantly.   However, I've recently had three deaths in my family and have incurred significant expenses on my credit cards, which is what brought me to lending club.  I would like to get these paid down sooner than later.   My other two debts include both a car loan and a student loan.  Roughly speaking, my monthly expenses total $1,700.00.  This includes my rent, utilities, car payment, insurance, cell phone, student loan payment, and ALL credit card payments.  After grad school, I joined a public accounting firm for 2 years.  I decided to join HealthCentral 1 Â½ years ago (18 months ago) to work as their internal Accountant. I report directly to the CFO.  Aside from specialized projects, my tasks generally include Accounts Payable, Billing, Monthly Closes, Audit Assistance, and maintaining valuable relationships with our media advertising clients.    I do have a savings account/emergency fund.  I had temporarily lent those funds to family given the extenuating circumstances.  However, I received a check yesterday, and will be replenishing that account this Friday, Oct 9th with $3,000.00. I am absolutely willing to provide income verification with Lending Club and will contact them now to find out how.  Please let me know if you have any further questions. Best!","debt_consolidation","VA",14.73,0,1,9,0,13154,88.3,15,0,8

I make enough in my current job that I can certainly afford loan payments, but would have to wait quite a while to save up enough to pay for my educational expenses up front. In the current economy, only the wealthy and the destitute(the only ones who qualify for much financial aid) can afford to go to school using the more traditional payment types. Because I make enough to live on, I don't have the opportunity to better myself without seeking a loan.   My credit history and score are reasonably good, and hopefully will be improving more in the coming years. I always make payments on time, and usually pay more than the minimum, because I don't really like being in debt. Also, the job info. on this site won't really give a good idea of how much I actually make. I recently (January of this year) got a job with the state of CT. In order to accomodate the schedule for it, I dropped myself down to on-call status with my other employer Sunrise Northeast, for whom I've worked for over 5 years. I take extra hours as a I please with both jobs, and therefore make 2-3 times my base pay, which is only about 1200 per month, pretax. Since I am able to take on more time, within certain limits of course, I can work more to pay for extras such as vacation, without sacrificing paying my bills. I believe that I am a good candidate because of the aforementioned, and hope that you will view me as such.

We ended up breaking up and now I pay for it myself. Thing is, I dont need a car that expensive, and I can't sell it to a private party because I make payments in it and I can't get the title until the car is paid off. You can't sell a car to a private party unless you hold the title.  I could sell to a dealer but they will pay me 6000 less than what I owe in the car so that is completely out of question. I owe $20300 in the car, a dealer would give me 14k and I can sell it to a private party for 19 or 20k.  Therefore, the purpuse of this loan is so that I can pay off my car, so I can get the title and sell it to a private party. Then I would use the sale money, whenever it sells, to buy a much cheaper car (I was thinking something like 5k) and use the rest as a down payment in a house I wanna buy.   The other option I would have to stop wasting money in this car is to have someone take over my car payments and just transfer the title to that person when the car is paid off. I find that very risky because the car would still me under my name and responsability and if the person doesnt make my payment in time it would affect my credit negatively when I am trying to buy a house.  I have never paid any bills late and I wouldn't let someone one do that with my name and credit. Not to mention the damage that can be done to the car and all things that can go wrong with that option.  I am a great candidate for this loan because I am an extremely honest and responsable person. I pay all my bills at least a week before their due date, always on time, and I always pay them until they are paid off. The only reason my credit is not even higher is because I am a foreigner and dont have enough credit history since I have only been in the States for 4 years.  I am a software enginner and I make enough money to pay this loan confortably. My monthly expense with rent and utilities is only $500. This is just an option to get rid of luxuries I dont need and use my money wisely.  Thank you. :)","car","NV",17.16,0,6,8,0,10022,24.7,12,0,5

This loan will be a great help in allowing me to move my life forward and create a future for myself and my family.<br/>","home_improvement","AZ",14.31,0,0,11,0,6995,51.8,35,0,18

I am new to the Lending Club and so I thought I might share with you why I am looking to the Lending Club for some financial assistance.  <br/><br/>In 2009 I made some bad credit choices by applying for a card from my local bank that carried an annual fee in addition to a high intrest rate.  No, problem, I thought, I won't be using this credit card anyway.  A few months later I got into an apartment and my room mate bailed on me the day I signed the lease.  I now had an apartment which I could not afford all on my own.  I also just got a new job for the new area I was in.  I couldn't afford to stay there but I couldn't afford to break the lease either.  So, I used the credit card to end the lease and move again and get my old job back.  It was a series of poor planning and bad financial decisions.  <br/><br/>If you invest in me, I plan to consolidate all of these high intrest cards (I have 1 and 2 lower intrest cards) and pay them off and close the high-intrest, annual fee one.  I can pay off the last $1800 on my CarMax car loan and be done with that one too.  With just one loan at a better rate I can focus on improving and aquiring a better income by adding on a part-time job.  My plan is to be debt free in 4 years.  <br/><br/>Thank you so much for your intrest in becoming my investor of my debt consolidation loan.

In fact, my first investment was some 18 years ago.  I am currently looking for private investors to fund Real Estate investments and trades (flips).  I off private investors 2 to 3 times CD rates on 60 to 70% loan-to-value secured investments.  Given our current RE and banking environment, opportunities are abundant in my area for the Real Estate business owner.   In fact potential deals are being discarded because too many projects can be counterproductive.  But with all these great deals, comes a greater need for working capital.   The high number of good deals available right now has created a need for a little extra working capital.  I have 2 rehab projects in progress right now and could use a little cushion to complete 2 rehab projects.   I am looking for opportunities to create some long term relationships with the right individuals.     This is a great opportunity for a lender (you) to earn a good rate of return and know that this money is being put into income producing properties - much more secure than debt consolidation, investing in a new business venture, or buying a depreciating product.  Those are all worthy loans, but if an investment is tied to a project to create more income or capital, then the loan (in my opinion) is quite strong.  I've recently gone from part time to full time investor; my passive income has not quite replaced my W2 income, but w/ the houses in the pipeline and 2 more sales of existing inventory, then replacement of the W2 income is assured.  Additionally, my wife is retired military and full time government contractor in San Antonio and has a very stable job, repayment a loan of this size, is not difficult.  Future and more sizeable loans with lenders desiring secured investments can be offered Notes w/ Trust Deeds.  ","small_business","TX",6.03,0,1,5,0,362,36.2,24,0,18

I realize your investment in me makes me part of your financial portfolio and I have a direct impact on you personally. I will be a star performer and affect your NAR positively.

The utility industry is not only avoiding lay-offs, but there are new and open positions at most companies in this field.

The APRs on these cards are approximately 11.99. <br/><br/>The reason for balances on these cards are due to:<br/>a) Relocation to NYC (go figure... nyc is not a cheap place to live!)<br/>b) Medical <br/><br/>As noted, I have had ZERO non payments, judgments, defaults, or late payments since my credit reporting history began.

My name is Roberto and I am currently a 24-year old medical student at the Stanford University School of Medicine. I am a kind and smart guy that is working on becoming an orthopedic surgeon.  In the past (2006) I used Prosper to borrow money to fix up my 1971 Chevrolet Nova Muscle Car and was very pleased with the experience.  I borrowed $3,000 and paid it off in 12 months.  I am now seeking $10,750 to invest in U.S. equities and will be paying off my loan in 36 months.  I am an extremely hard working guy that was top of my class in college.  I am a very low risk borrower as I have NEVER been late on a credit card payment or peer-to-peer lending payment.  I have a lot going for me and will not risk messing up my credit or reputation by being late on any payments to a lender.  I have recently been awarded a prestigious scholarship that will be paying for half of medical school and you can see my bio at http://www.pdsoros.org/current_fellows/   The condensed version of my finances is that I have over $23,000 in cash, all of my vehicles are paid for and worth around $30,000, owe $8000 on my credit cards (that in combination with the fact that as a medical student I get a living allowance of $2500/month, I only use $1700 of it, does not show up as income and causes me to have a low credit score), go to medical school on a near full-ride, and have positive cash flow exceeding $800/month after all my expenses are taken into account.  I am getting married this summer and will be living on campus with my wife who just finished her Masters and is a college professor.  Her income will cover groceries, gas, and other living expenses meaning that I foresee positive cash flow of over $1100/month starting this fall. I will also be selling two of my classic muscle cars this summer.  You may ask why I have $8,000 in credit card debt when I have $23,000 in cash and $30,000 in assets?  That is because I have a 0% APR card and have wanted the cash cushion for now.  I do not foresee any big expenses as I have already paid for the ring, we have paid for the honeymoon, and our parents are paying for the wedding. I would just rather have that cash available right now as we start our new life together and as soon as my 0% APR deal ends I will pay the cards off.  I will have more than enough positive cash flow each month to make the payment on this $10,750 loan.   During the summer break between my sophomore and junior years of college I did an investment banking internship and had the opportunity to learn about the world of economics and equities.  Since then I have followed the world financial markets with a close eye and have become very passionate about investing. This enormous downturn, the worst since the Great Depression, has left good companies (in infrastructure, tech, agriculture, shipping) trading at a fraction of what they were.  It has also removed a large amount of risk in investing and has presented an opportunity with enormous upside potential as a recovery looms on the horizon as has happened after every U.S. economic crisis in history.  In 2006 and 2007 I actively invested a sum of $10,000 and turned it into $20,000 through learning to manage risk with stops, investing on a mixture of momentum, news, technical analysis, and fundamentals, not letting emotion, greed, or fear make me hold losing positions, learning to sell my losses and ride my gains, etc.  I am happy that I sold everything before the crisis and was able to buy my dream car at the time with the proceeds in late 2007 (2004 BMW 330Ci).  Seeing this opportunity after the economic crisis and the recovery on the horizon (next couple years) has once again convinced me to start to move some money ($5,000) back into the market in the past month with a focus on managing risk with tight stops and have made some great profits already.  I would like to increase the size of this portfolio as soon as possible with the proceeds from this loan.","small_business","CA",14.98,0,0,9,0,26333,77.2,14,0,9

I wanted (needed) to be her first and main source of care and a moral compass for her.  I chose to (joyfully) care for other parent's children while they had to work, allowing me to work and make a safe home for us.  It was a win - win situation.  Fast forward 16 years later, my daughter is planning where to go to college, I am a happy licensed Condominium Manager on the beach in a gorgeous high rise (I rent way in-land) and I am finally in a position to purchase a modest home for us.  I've been  itching to make upgrades to the condo we've been renting, but the owner has fallen into foreclosure and we can not stay here.  I have been able to save $5,000 and would like a loan for $12,000.  It is just the two of us.  I have no extended family to ask, and I am not the type of person to go asking friends.  I prefer to work for what I have even if I need to go about it the hard way. I also prefer not to give banks my money as I would like to help the economy from the inside track.  Direct; people with a need helping other people with a need.  I hope we may help each other reach our goals together.  ","house","FL",15.39,0,2,7,0,16862,54.7,7,0,11

Without the cash on hand, I was forced to take cash advances from my credit cards.  That's why several balances are high.<br/><br/>With this consolidation loan, I would pay-off and close the 2 Home Equity Line of Credit accounts, which are currently at 21.75 and 20.99% interest.  I pay more than the monthly minimum on each, but the high interest make that payoff slow.  On my credit cards, one account is closed, and I'm on an autopay play to pay that off in 2.5 years.  On another card, I'll pay down the balance to $3700 (provided I receive the full $24,250 loan), and will pay off the remaining balance within 12-16 months.  On the final card, I'm making $700 per month payments, and will have it paid off in 24 months.  I'm driving a 2006 jeep, with no plans to purchase anything new until the consolidation loan is paid in full.<br/><br/>As soon as the last 2 cards are paid off, I'll direct those additional funds toward the repayment of the consolidation loan (in addition to the $847 per month payment.
